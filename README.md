# Simon Game Project

This repository contains the source code for a web-based version of the classic Simon memory game. This game tests players' memory skills by requiring them to replicate a sequence of colors in the correct order.

## How to Play

1. The game starts by randomly illuminating one of the four colors.
2. The player must remember the order and repeat the colors accordingly.
3. With each successful attempt, the sequence becomes longer by one additional color.
4. If the player makes a mistake, the game restarts from the beginning.

## Features

- Responsive Design: Playable on both desktops and mobile devices.
- Sound Effects: Each color has a specific sound that plays when activated.
- Increasing Difficulty: The speed of the sequence presentation increases with each level.

## Technologies

- HTML
